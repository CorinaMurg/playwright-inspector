# Hello üê∫ QA Wolf! üëã

I'm Corina. 

This project is my solution to the take-home assignment for the QA Engineer role.
Specifically, it answers the following prompt:
- Edit the `index.js` file in this project to go to [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and validate that the first 100 articles are sorted from newest to oldest.


## How to get it started

1. Install node modules: `npm i`

2. Run script: `npm run build:start`


## Contact

This project was fun, fun, fun. And an opportunity to learn a few more JavaScript tricks along the way.
Thank you for it, and looking forward to hearing back from you! For any questions, feel free to reach me at [corina.murg@gmail.com](mailto:corina.murg@gmail.com).
