# ðŸŽ­ Playwright Inspector

Hey there! This is a neat "how cool is Playwright" project.
Check it out to see how easy it is to integrate Playwright with other tools to automate web tasks and manage data exports.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- Playwright
- JavaScript
- Express

## Additional Tools
- node readline (for command line interactions)
- axios (for HTTP requests)
- json2csv (for converting JSON data to CSV files)

## What Does It Do?
A lot!
- **Automated Sorting Verification**: Checks that the Hacker News latest articles are displayed in descending order
- **Express Server Integration**: A lightweight server setup to manage download requests
- **Command Line Interaction**: Users can interact with the program via the command line to perform checks and request downloads
- **CSV Data Export**: Saves the timestamp data as a CSV file (for the skeptic in all of us ðŸ˜‰)


## Getting Started
1. **Install Node Modules**: Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute `npm run build:start` to start the server and begin interacting with the application.
